This repository includes the data measured from the experiments. For both files, the first column corresponds to time (s), the columns 2 to 5 are the electrode potential (V) for electrodes 1 to 4 respectively and columns 6 to 9 to the phase for electrodes 1 to 4 respectively.

1. `uncoupled.txt`

This file contains the time series from the experiments without coupling

2. `coupled.txt` 

This file contains the time series from the experiments with coupling.
